            tasks such as the following:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>They spend their time doing what needs to be done to ensure the projects

        <paragraph>A core reviewer’s responsibility doesn’t end up with merging code. The above

            <title>Core Review Hierarchy</title>
            <paragraph>As Neutron has grown in complexity, it has become impossible for any one
                person to know enough to merge changes across the entire codebase. Areas of
                expertise have developed organically, and it is not uncommon for existing
                cores to defer to these experts when changes are proposed. Existing cores
                should be aware of the implications when they do merge changes outside the
                scope of their knowledge. It is with this in mind we propose a new system
                built around Lieutenants through a model of trust.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In order to scale development and responsibility in Neutron, we have adopted
                a Lieutenant system. The PTL is the leader of the Neutron project, and
                ultimately responsible for decisions made in the project. The PTL has
                designated Lieutenants in place to help run portions of the Neutron project.
                The Lieutenants are in charge of their own areas, and they can propose core
                reviewers for their areas as well. The core reviewer addition and removal
                polices are in place below. The Lieutenants for each system, while responsible
                for their area, ultimately report to the PTL. The PTL may opt to have regular
                one on one meetings with the lieutenants. The PTL will resolve disputes in
                the project that arise between areas of focus, core reviewers, and other
                projects. Please note Lieutenants should be leading their own area of focus,
                not doing all the work themselves.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As was mentioned in the previous section, a core’s responsibilities do not
                end with merging code. They are responsible for bug triage and gate issues
                among other things. Lieutenants have an increased responsibility to ensure
                gate and bug triage for their area of focus is under control.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The following are the current Neutron Lieutenants.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Existing core reviewers have been reviewing code for a varying degree of
                cycles. With the new plan of Lieutenants and ownership, it’s fair to try to
                understand how they fit into the new model. Existing core reviewers seem
                to mostly focus in particular areas and are cognizant of their own strengths
                and weaknesses. These members may not be experts in all areas, but know their
                limits, and will not exceed those limits when reviewing changes outside their
                area of expertise. The model is built on trust, and when that trust is broken,
                responsibilities will be taken away.</paragraph>

            interactions with other projects. It also means you pay attention to release
            milestones and understand if a patch you’re merging is marked for the release,
            especially critical during the feature freeze.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The bottom line here is merging code is a responsibility Neutron core reviewers
            have.</paragraph>

            <title>Adding or Removing Core Reviewers</title>
            <paragraph>A new Neutron core reviewer may be proposed at anytime on the openstack-dev
                mailing list. Typically, the Lieutenant for a given area will propose a new
                core reviewer for their specific area of coverage, though the Neutron PTL may
                propose new core reviewers as well. The proposal is typically made after
                discussions with existing core reviewers. Once a proposal has been made,
                three existing Neutron core reviewers from the Lieutenant’s area of focus must
                respond to the email with a +1. If the member is being added by a Lieutenant
                from an area of focus with less than three members, a simple majority will be
                used to determine if the vote is successful. Another Neutron core reviewer
                from the same area of focus can vote -1 to veto the proposed new core
                reviewer. The PTL will mediate all disputes for core reviewer additions.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The PTL may remove a Neutron core reviewer at any time. Typically when a
                member has decreased their involvement with the project through a drop in
                reviews and participation in general project development, the PTL will propose
                their removal and remove them. Please note there is no voting or vetoing of
                core reviewer removal. Members who have previously been a core reviewer may be
                fast-tracked back into a core reviewer role if their involvement picks back up
                and the existing core reviewers support their re-instatement.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Please note in-person attendance at design summits, mid-cycles, and other code
                sprints is not a requirement to be a Neutron core reviewer. The Neutron team
                will do its best to facilitate virtual attendance at all events. Travel is not
                to be taken lightly, and we realize the costs involved for those who partake
                in attending these events.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In addition to the above, code reviews are the most important requirement of
                Neutron core reviewers. Neutron follows the documented OpenStack <reference name="code review guidelines" refuri="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReviewChecklist">code review
                    guidelines</reference><target ids="code-review-guidelines" names="code\ review\ guidelines" refuri="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReviewChecklist"></target>. We encourage
                all people to review Neutron patches, but core reviewers are required to
                maintain a level of review numbers relatively close to other core reviewers.
                There are no hard statistics around code review numbers, but in general we
                use 30, 60, 90 and 180 day stats when examining review stats.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>There are soft-touch items around being a Neutron core reviewer as well.
                Gaining trust with the existing Neutron core reviewers is important. Being
                able to work together with the existing Neutron core reviewer team is
                critical as well. Being a Neutron core reviewer means spending a significant
                amount of time with the existing Neutron core reviewers team on IRC, the
                mailing list, at Summits, and in reviews. Ensuring you participate and engage
                here is critical to becoming and remaining a core reviewer.</paragraph>
