        <title>Transient DB Failure Injection</title>
        <paragraph>Neutron has a service plugin to inject random delays and Deadlock exceptions
            into normal Neutron operations. The service plugin is called ‘Loki’ and is
            located under neutron.services.loki.loki_plugin.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To enable the plugin, just add ‘loki’ to the list of service_plugins in your
            neutron-server neutron.conf file.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The plugin will inject a Deadlock exception on database flushes with a 1/50
            probability and a delay of 1 second with a 1/200 probability when SQLAlchemy
            objects are loaded into the persistent state from the DB. The goal is to ensure
            the code is tolerant of these transient delays/failures that will be experienced
            in busy production (and Galera) systems.</paragraph>
