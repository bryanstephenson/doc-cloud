        <title>Integration with external DNS services</title>
        <paragraph>Since the Mitaka release, neutron has an interface defined to interact with an
            external DNS service. This interface is based on an abstract driver that can be
            used as the base class to implement concrete drivers to interact with various
            DNS services. The reference implementation of such a driver integrates neutron
            with

        <paragraph>This integration allows users to publish <emphasis>dns_name</emphasis> and <emphasis>dns_domain</emphasis>
            attributes associated with floating IP addresses, ports, and networks in an
            external DNS service.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>To support integration with an external DNS service, the <emphasis>dns_name</emphasis> and
                <emphasis>dns_domain</emphasis> attributes were added to floating ips, ports and networks. The
                <emphasis>dns_name</emphasis> specifies the name to be associated with a corresponding IP address,
                both of which will be published to an existing domain with the name
                <emphasis>dns_domain</emphasis> in the external DNS service.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Specifically, floating ips, ports and networks are extended as follows:</paragraph>
