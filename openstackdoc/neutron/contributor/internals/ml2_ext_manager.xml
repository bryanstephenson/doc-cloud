        <title>ML2 Extension Manager</title>
        <paragraph>The extension manager for ML2 was introduced in Juno (more details
            can be found in the approved <reference name="spec" refuri="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/juno/neutron-ml2-mechanismdriver-extensions.html">spec</reference><target ids="spec" names="spec" refuri="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/juno/neutron-ml2-mechanismdriver-extensions.html"></target>). The features allows for extending ML2 resources without
            actually having to introduce cross cutting concerns to ML2. The
            mechanism has been applied for a number of use cases, and extensions
            that currently use this frameworks are available under <reference name="ml2/extensions" refuri="https://github.com/openstack/neutron/tree/master/neutron/plugins/ml2/extensions">ml2/extensions</reference><target ids="ml2-extensions" names="ml2/extensions" refuri="https://github.com/openstack/neutron/tree/master/neutron/plugins/ml2/extensions"></target>.</paragraph>
