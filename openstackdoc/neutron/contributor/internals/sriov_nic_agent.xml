        <title>L2 Networking with SR-IOV enabled NICs</title>
        <paragraph>SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) is a specification that allows
            a PCIe device to appear to be multiple separate physical PCIe devices.
            SR-IOV works by introducing the idea of physical functions (PFs) and virtual functions (VFs).
            Physical functions (PFs) are full-featured PCIe functions.
            Virtual functions (VFs) are “lightweight” functions that lack configuration resources.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>SR-IOV supports VLANs for L2 network isolation, other networking technologies
            such as VXLAN/GRE may be supported in the future.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>SR-IOV NIC agent manages configuration of SR-IOV Virtual Functions that connect
            VM instances running on the compute node to the public network.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In most common deployments, there are compute and a network nodes.
            Compute node can support VM connectivity via SR-IOV enabled NIC. SR-IOV NIC Agent manages
            Virtual Functions admin state. Quality of service is partially implemented with the bandwidth limit
            and minimum bandwidth rules. In the future it will manage additional settings, such as additional
            quality of service rules, rate limit settings, spoofcheck and more.
            Network node will be usually deployed with either Open vSwitch or Linux Bridge to support network node functionality.</paragraph>
