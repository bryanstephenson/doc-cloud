            <paragraph>The object of this document is to inform users whether or not
                features are complete, well documented, stable, and tested.
                This approach ensures good user experience for those well maintained features.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>Tests are specific to particular combinations of technologies.
                    The plugins chosen for deployment make a big difference to whether
                    or not features will work.</paragraph>

                    use cases.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>An immature feature is a feature being actively developed, which is only
                    partially functional and upstream tested, most likely introduced in a
                    recent release, and that will take time to mature thanks to feedback
                    from downstream QA.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Users of these features will likely identify gaps and/or defects
                    that were not identified during specification and code review.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Required features are core networking principles that have been thoroughly
                    tested and have been implemented in real world use cases.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>In addition they satisfy the same criteria for any mature features.</paragraph>
                <note>
                    <paragraph>Any new drivers must prove that they support all required features
                        before they are merged into neutron.</paragraph>
