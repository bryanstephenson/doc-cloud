            <paragraph>As of Juno, the OpenStack Networking service (neutron) provides two
                new attributes to the subnet object, which allows users of the API to
                configure IPv6 subnets.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are two IPv6 attributes:</paragraph>
            <bullet_list bullet="*">

            <paragraph>These attributes can be set to the following values:</paragraph>

                <title>IPv6 addressing</title>
                <paragraph>The <literal>ipv6_address_mode</literal> attribute is used to control how addressing is
                    handled by OpenStack. There are a number of different ways that guest
                    instances can obtain an IPv6 address, and this attribute exposes these
                    choices to users of the Networking API.</paragraph>

                <title>Router advertisements</title>
                <paragraph>The <literal>ipv6_ra_mode</literal> attribute is used to control router
                    advertisements for a subnet.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The IPv6 Protocol uses Internet Control Message Protocol packets
                    (ICMPv6) as a way to distribute information about networking. ICMPv6
                    packets with the type flag set to 134 are called “Router
                    Advertisement” packets, which contain information about the router
                    and the route that can be used by guest instances to send network
                    traffic.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The <literal>ipv6_ra_mode</literal> is used to specify if the Networking service should
                    generate Router Advertisement packets for a subnet.</paragraph>

            <title>Router support</title>
            <paragraph>The behavior of the neutron router for IPv6 is different than for IPv4 in
                a few ways.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Internal router ports, that act as default gateway ports for a network, will
                share a common port for all IPv6 subnets associated with the network. This
                implies that there will be an IPv6 internal router interface with multiple
                IPv6 addresses from each of the IPv6 subnets associated with the network and a
                separate IPv4 internal router interface for the IPv4 subnet. On the other
                hand, external router ports are allowed to have a dual-stack configuration
                with both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address assigned to them.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Neutron project networks that are assigned Global Unicast Address (GUA)
                prefixes and addresses don’t require NAT on the neutron router external gateway
                port to access the outside world. As a consequence of the lack of NAT the
                external router port doesn’t require a GUA to send and receive to the external
                networks. This implies a GUA IPv6 subnet prefix is not necessarily needed for
                the neutron external network. By default, a IPv6 LLA associated with the
                external gateway port can be used for routing purposes. To handle this
                scenario, the implementation of router-gateway-set API in neutron has been
                modified so that an IPv6 subnet is not required for the external network that
                is associated with the neutron router. The LLA address of the upstream router
                can be learned in two ways.</paragraph>
            <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix=".">
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>In the absence of an upstream RA support, <literal>ipv6_gateway</literal> flag can be set
                        with the external router gateway LLA in the neutron L3 agent configuration
                        file. This also requires that no subnet is associated with that port.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>The upstream router can send an RA and the neutron router will
                        automatically learn the next-hop LLA, provided again that no subnet is
                        assigned and the <literal>ipv6_gateway</literal> flag is not set.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </enumerated_list>
            <paragraph>Effectively the <literal>ipv6_gateway</literal> flag takes precedence over an RA that
                is received from the upstream router. If it is desired to use a GUA
                next hop that is accomplished by allocating a subnet to the external
                router port and assigning the upstream routers GUA address as the
                gateway for the subnet.</paragraph>
            <note>
                <paragraph>It should be possible for projects to communicate with each other
                    on an isolated network (a network without a router port) using LLA
                    with little to no participation on the part of OpenStack. The authors
                    of this section have not proven that to be true for all scenarios.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <note>
                <paragraph>When using the neutron L3 agent in a configuration where it is
                    auto-configuring an IPv6 address via SLAAC, and the agent is
                    learning its default IPv6 route from the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement,
                    it may be necessary to set the
                    <literal>net.ipv6.conf.&lt;physical_interface&gt;.accept_ra</literal> sysctl to the
                    value <literal>2</literal> in order for routing to function correctly.

                <paragraph>At the current time OpenStack Networking does not provide any facility
                    to support any flavor of NAT with IPv6. Unlike IPv4 there is no
                    current embedded support for floating IPs with IPv6. It is assumed
                    that the IPv6 addressing amongst the projects is using GUAs with no

                <paragraph>OpenStack currently doesn’t support the privacy extensions defined by RFC 4941.
                    The interface identifier and DUID used must be directly derived from the MAC
                    as described in RFC 2373. The compute hosts must not be setup to utilize the
                    privacy extensions when generating their interface identifier.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>There is no provisions for an IPv6-based metadata service similar to what is
                    provided for IPv4. In the case of dual stacked guests though it is always
                    possible to use the IPv4 metadata service instead.</paragraph>

                network can be run in a dual stack configuration and OpenStack API
                endpoints can be accessed via an IPv6 network. At this time, Open vSwitch
                (OVS) tunnel types - STT, VXLAN, GRE, support both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>From the Liberty release onwards, OpenStack Networking supports IPv6 prefix
                delegation. This section describes the configuration and workflow steps
                necessary to use IPv6 prefix delegation to provide automatic allocation of
                subnet CIDRs. This allows you as the OpenStack administrator to rely on an
                external (to the OpenStack Networking service) DHCPv6 server to manage your
                project network prefixes.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Prefix delegation became available in the Liberty release, it is
                    not available in the Kilo release. HA and DVR routers
                    are not currently supported by this feature.</paragraph>

                <title>Requirements</title>
                <paragraph>To use this feature, you need a prefix delegation capable DHCPv6 server that is
                    reachable from your OpenStack Networking node(s). This could be software
                    running on the OpenStack Networking node(s) or elsewhere, or a physical router.
                    For the purposes of this guide we are using the open-source DHCPv6 server,
                    Dibbler. Dibbler is available in many Linux package managers, or from source at
                    <reference name="tomaszmrugalski/dibbler" refuri="https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/dibbler">tomaszmrugalski/dibbler</reference><target ids="tomaszmrugalski-dibbler" names="tomaszmrugalski/dibbler" refuri="https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/dibbler"></target>.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>When using the reference implementation of the OpenStack Networking prefix
                    delegation driver, Dibbler must also be installed on your OpenStack Networking
                    node(s) to serve as a DHCPv6 client. Version 1.0.1 or higher is required.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>This guide assumes that you are running a Dibbler server on the network node
                    where the external network bridge exists. If you already have a prefix
                    delegation capable DHCPv6 server in place, then you can skip the following

                <paragraph>The prefix delegation mechanism then sends a request via the external network
                    to your prefix delegation server, which replies with the delegated prefix. The
                    subnet is then updated with the new prefix, including issuing new IP addresses
                    to all ports:</paragraph>

                <paragraph>If the prefix delegation server is configured to delegate globally routable
                    prefixes and setup routes, then any instance with a port on this subnet should
                    now have external network access.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Deleting the router interface causes the subnet to be reverted to the temporary
                    CIDR, and all ports have their IPs updated. Prefix leases are released and
                    renewed automatically as necessary.</paragraph>
