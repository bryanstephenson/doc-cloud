        <title>Deployment examples</title>
        <paragraph>The following deployment examples provide building blocks of increasing
            architectural complexity using the Networking service reference architecture
            which implements the Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plug-in and either the Open
            vSwitch (OVS) or Linux bridge mechanism drivers. Both mechanism drivers support
            the same basic features such as provider networks, self-service networks,
            and routers. However, more complex features often require a particular
            mechanism driver. Thus, you should consider the requirements (or goals) of
            your cloud before choosing a mechanism driver.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After choosing a <reference internal="True" refid="deploy-mechanism-drivers"><inline classes="std std-ref">mechanism driver</inline></reference>, the
            deployment examples generally include the following building blocks:</paragraph>

            <title>Prerequisites</title>
            <paragraph>Prerequisites, typically hardware requirements, generally increase with each
                building block. Each building block depends on proper deployment and operation
                of prior building blocks. For example, the first building block (provider
                networks) only requires one controller and two compute nodes, the second
                building block (self-service networks) adds a network node, and the
                high-availability building blocks typically add a second network node for a
                total of five nodes. Each building block could also require additional
                infrastructure or changes to existing infrastructure such as networks.</paragraph>
