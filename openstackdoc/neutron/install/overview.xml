        <title>Overview</title>
        <paragraph>The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform that
            supports all types of cloud environments. The project aims for simple
            implementation, massive scalability, and a rich set of features. Cloud
            computing experts from around the world contribute to the project.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>OpenStack provides an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution
            through a variety of complementary services. Each service offers an
            Application Programming Interface (API) that facilitates this
            integration.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This guide covers step-by-step deployment of the major OpenStack
            services using a functional example architecture suitable for
            new users of OpenStack with sufficient Linux experience. This guide is not
            intended to be used for production system installations, but to create a
            minimum proof-of-concept for the purpose of learning about OpenStack.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After becoming familiar with basic installation, configuration, operation,
            and troubleshooting of these OpenStack services, you should consider the
            following steps toward deployment using a production architecture:</paragraph>
        <bullet_list bullet="*">
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>Determine and implement the necessary core and optional services to
                    meet performance and redundancy requirements.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>Increase security using methods such as firewalls, encryption, and
                    service policies.</paragraph>
            </list_item>
            <list_item>
                <paragraph>Implement a deployment tool such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Salt
                    to automate deployment and management of the production environment.</paragraph>

            <title>Example architecture</title>
            <paragraph>The example architecture requires at least two nodes (hosts) to launch a basic
                virtual machine (VM) or instance. Optional services such as Block Storage and
                Object Storage require additional nodes.</paragraph>
            <important>
                <paragraph>The example architecture used in this guide is a minimum configuration,
                    and is not intended for production system installations. It is designed to
                    provide a minimum proof-of-concept for the purpose of learning about
                    OpenStack. For information on creating architectures for specific
                    use cases, or how to determine which architecture is required, see the

            </important>
            <paragraph>This example architecture differs from a minimal production architecture as
                follows:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Networking agents reside on the controller node instead of one or more
                        dedicated network nodes.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Overlay (tunnel) traffic for self-service networks traverses the management
                        network instead of a dedicated network.</paragraph>

                <title>Controller</title>
                <paragraph>The controller node runs the Identity service, Image service, management
                    portions of Compute, management portion of Networking, various Networking
                    agents, and the Dashboard. It also includes supporting services such as
                    an SQL database, message queue, and Network Time Protocol (NTP).</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Optionally, the controller node runs portions of the Block Storage, Object
                    Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry services.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The compute node runs the hypervisor portion of Compute that
                    operates instances. By default, Compute uses the kernel-based VM (KVM)
                    hypervisor. The compute node also runs a Networking service
                    agent that connects instances to virtual networks
                    and provides firewalling services to instances via security groups.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You can deploy more than one compute node. Each node requires a minimum
                    of two network interfaces.</paragraph>

                    Storage and Shared File System services provision for instances.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>For simplicity, service traffic between compute nodes and this node
                    uses the management network. Production environments should implement
                    a separate storage network to increase performance and security.</paragraph>

                <title>Networking Option 1: Provider networks</title>
                <paragraph>The provider networks option deploys the OpenStack Networking service
                    in the simplest way possible with primarily layer-2 (bridging/switching)
                    services and VLAN segmentation of networks. Essentially, it bridges virtual
                    networks to physical networks and relies on physical network infrastructure
                    for layer-3 (routing) services. Additionally, a DHCP&lt;Dynamic Host
                    Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service provides IP address information to
                    instances.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The OpenStack user requires more information about the underlying network
                    infrastructure to create a virtual network to exactly match the
                    infrastructure.</paragraph>
                <warning>
                    <paragraph>This option lacks support for self-service (private) networks, layer-3
                        (routing) services, and advanced services such as
                        Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) and FireWall-as-a-Service (FWaaS).
                        Consider the self-service networks option below if you desire these features.</paragraph>

                <title>Networking Option 2: Self-service networks</title>
                <paragraph>The self-service networks option augments the provider networks option
                    with layer-3 (routing) services that enable
                    self-service networks using overlay segmentation methods such
                    as Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). Essentially, it routes
                    virtual networks to physical networks using Network Address
                    Translation (NAT). Additionally, this option provides the foundation for
                    advanced services such as LBaaS and FWaaS.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The OpenStack user can create virtual networks without the knowledge
                    of underlying infrastructure on the data network. This can also include
                    VLAN networks if the layer-2 plug-in is configured accordingly.</paragraph>
