  <title>View and manage load balancers v2</title>
  <para>Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) enables networking to distribute incoming
            requests evenly among designated instances. This distribution ensures that
            the workload is shared predictably among instances and enables more effective
            use of system resources. Use one of these load-balancing methods to distribute
            incoming requests:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Round robin: Rotates requests evenly between multiple instances.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Source IP: Requests from a unique source IP address are consistently
                    directed to the same instance.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Least connections: Allocates requests to the instance with the
                    least number of active connections.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>As an end user, you can create and manage load balancers and related
            objects for users in various projects. You can also delete load balancers
            and related objects.</para>
  <para>LBaaS v2 has several new concepts to understand:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Load balancer</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The load balancer occupies a neutron network port and
                        has an IP address assigned from a subnet.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Listener</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Each port that listens for traffic on a particular load balancer is
                        configured separately and tied to the load balancer. Multiple listeners can
                        be associated with the same load balancer.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Pool</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>A pool is a group of hosts that sits behind the load balancer and
                        serves traffic through the load balancer.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Member</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Members are the actual IP addresses that receive traffic from
                        the load balancer. Members are associated with pools.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Health monitor</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Members may go offline from time to time and health monitors
                        diverts traffic away from members that are not responding properly.
                        Health monitors are associated with pools.</para>

        <para>Keep in mind, the health checks routinely run against each instance
                        within a target load balancer and the result of the health check is
                        used to determine if the instance receives new connections.</para>
