  <title>Tutorial: Creating an Horizon Plugin</title>
  <section>
    <title>Why should I package my code as a plugin?</title>
    <para>We highly encourage that you write and maintain your code using our plugin
                architecture. A plugin by definition means the ability to be connected. In
                practical terms, plugins are a way to extend and add to the functionality that
                already exists. You can control its content and progress at a rate independent
                of Horizon. If you write and package your code as a plugin, it will continue to
                work in future releases.</para>
    <para>Writing your code as a plugin also modularizes your code making it easier to
                translate and test. This also makes it easier for deployers to consume your code
                allowing selective enablement of features. We are currently using this pattern
                internally for our dashboards.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Creating the Plugin</title>
    <para>This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, HTML,
                JavaScript. Knowledge of AngularJS is optional but recommended if you are
                attempting to create an Angular plugin.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Name of your repository</title>
      <para>Needless to say, it is important to choose a meaningful repository name.</para>
      <para>In addition, if you plan to support translation on your dashboard plugin,
                    it is recommended to choose a name like <literal>xxxx-dashboard</literal>
                    (or <literal>xxxx-ui</literal>. <literal>xxxx-horizon</literal>). The OpenStack CI infra script
                    considers a repository with these suffixes as Django project.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Types of Plugins that add content</title>
      <para>The file structure for your plugin type will be different depending on your
                    needs. Your plugin can be categorized into two types:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Plugins that create new panels or dashboards</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Plugins that modify existing workflows, actions, etc… (Angular only)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>We will cover the basics of working with panels for both Python and Angular.
                    If you are interested in creating a new panel, follow the steps below.</para>
      <note>
        <para>This tutorial shows you how to create a new panel. If you are
                        interested in creating a new dashboard plugin, use the file
                        structure from <xref linkend="tutorials-dashboard"/> instead.</para>

      <para>If you are creating a Python plugin, you may ignore the <literal>static</literal> folder. Most
                    of the classes you need are provided for in Python. If you intend on adding
                    custom front-end logic, you will need to include additional JavaScript here.</para>
      <para>An AngularJS plugin is a collection of JavaScript files or static resources.
                    Because it runs entirely in your browser, we need to place all of our static
                    resources inside the <literal>static</literal> folder. This ensures that the Django static
                    collector picks it up and distributes it to the browser correctly.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Enabled File</title>
      <para>The enabled folder contains the configuration file(s) that registers your
                    plugin with Horizon. The file is prefixed with an alpha-numeric string that
                    determines the load order of your plugin. For more information on what you can
                    include in this file, see pluggable settings in <xref linkend="install-settings"/>.</para>
      <para>_31000_myplugin.py:</para>

      <note>

    </section>
    <section>
      <title>my_rest_api.py</title>
      <para>This file will likely be necessary if creating a plugin using Angular. Your
                    plugin will need to communicate with a new service or require new interactions
                    with a service already supported by Horizon. In this particular example, the
                    plugin will augment the support for the already supported Identity service,
                    Keystone. This file serves to define new REST interfaces for the plugin’s
                    client-side to communicate with Horizon. Typically, the REST interfaces here
                    make calls into <literal>myservice.py</literal>.</para>
      <para>This file is unnecessary in a purely Django based plugin, or if your Angular
                    based plugin is relying on CORS support in the desired service. For more
                    information on CORS, see
                    <link xlink:href="https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.middleware/latest/admin/cross-project-cors.html"/></para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>myservice.py</title>
      <para>This file will likely be necessary if creating a Django or Angular driven
                    plugin. This file is intended to act as a convenient location for interacting
                    with the new service this plugin is supporting. While interactions with the
                    service can be handled in the <literal>views.py</literal>, isolating the logic is an
                    established pattern in Horizon.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>panel.py</title>
      <para>We define a panel where our plugin’s content will reside in. This is currently a
                    necessity even for Angular plugins. The slug is the panel’s unique identifier
                    and is often use as part of the URL. Make sure that it matches what you have in
                    your enabled file.:</para>
      <screen>from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
import horizon


class MyPanel(horizon.Panel):
    name = _("My Panel")
    slug = "mypanel"</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>tests.py</title>
      <para>Write some tests for the Django portion of your plugin and place them here.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>urls.py</title>
      <para>Now that we have a panel, we need to provide a URL so that users can visit our
                    new panel! This URL generally will point to a view.:</para>
      <screen>from django.conf.urls import url

from myplugin.content.mypanel import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
]</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>views.py</title>
      <para>Because rendering is done client-side, all our view needs is to reference some
                    HTML page. If you are writing a Python plugin, this view can be much more
                    complex. Refer to the topic guides for more details.:</para>
      <screen>from django.views import generic


class IndexView(generic.TemplateView):
    template_name = 'identity/mypanel/index.html'</screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>index.html</title>
      <para>The index HTML is where rendering occurs. In this example, we are only using
                    Django. If you are interested in using Angular directives instead, read the
                    AngularJS section below.:</para>
      <screen>{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load i18n %}
{% block title %}{% trans "My plugin" %}{% endblock %}

{% block page_header %}
  {% include "horizon/common/_domain_page_header.html"
    with title=_("My Panel") %}
{% endblock page_header %}

{% block main %}
  Hello world!
{% endblock %}</screen>
      <para>At this point, you have a very basic plugin. Note that new templates are
                    required to extend base.html. Including base.html is important for a number of
                    reasons. It is the template that contains all of your static resources along
                    with any functionality external to your panel (things like navigation, context
                    selection, etc…). As of this moment, this is also true for Angular plugins.</para>

    <title>AngularJS Plugin</title>
    <para>If you have no plans to add AngularJS to your plugin, you may skip this section.
                In the tutorial below, we will show you how to customize your panel using
                Angular.</para>
    <section>
      <title>index.html</title>
      <para>The index HTML is where rendering occurs and serves as an entry point for
                    Angular. This is where we start to diverge from the traditional Python plugin.
                    In this example, we use a Django template as the glue to our Angular template.
                    Why are we going through a Django template for an Angular plugin? Long story
                    short, <literal>base.html</literal> contains the navigation piece that we still need for each
                    panel.</para>
      <screen>{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load i18n %}
{% block title %}{% trans "My panel" %}{% endblock %}

{% block page_header %}
  &lt;hz-page-header
    header="{$ 'My panel' | translate $}"
    description="{$ 'My custom panel!' | translate $}"&gt;
  &lt;/hz-page-header&gt;
{% endblock page_header %}

{% block main %}
  &lt;ng-include
    src="'{{ STATIC_URL }}dashboard/identity/myplugin/mypanel/mypanel.html'"&gt;
  &lt;/ng-include&gt;
{% endblock %}</screen>
      <para>This template contains both Django and AngularJS code. Angular is denoted by
                    {$..$} while Django is denoted by {{..}} and {%..%}. This template gets
                    processed twice, once by Django on the server-side and once more by Angular on
                    the client-side. This means that the expressions in {{..}} and {%..%} are
                    substituted with values by the time it reaches your Angular template.</para>
      <para>What you chose to include in <literal>block main</literal> is entirely up to you. Since you are
                    creating an Angular plugin, we recommend that you keep everything in this
                    section Angular. Do not mix Python code in here! If you find yourself passing in
                    Python data, do it via our REST services instead.</para>
      <para>Remember to always use <literal>STATIC_URL</literal> when referencing your static resources.
                    This ensures that changes to the static path in settings will continue to serve
                    your static resources properly.</para>
      <note>
        <para>Angular’s directives are prefixed with ng. Similarly, Horizon’s directives
                        are prefixed with hz. You can think of them as namespaces.</para>
      </note>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>mypanel.js</title>
      <para>Your controller is the glue between the model and the view. In this example, we
                    are going to give it some fake data to render. To load more complex data,
                    consider using the $http service.</para>
      <screen>(function() {
  'use strict';

  angular
    .module('horizon.dashboard.identity.myplugin.mypanel', [])
    .controller('horizon.dashboard.identity.myPluginController',
      myPluginController);

  myPluginController.$inject = [ '$http' ];

  function myPluginController($http) {
    var ctrl = this;
    ctrl.items = [
      { name: 'abc', id: 123 },
      { name: 'efg', id: 345 },
      { name: 'hij', id: 678 }
    ];
  }
})();</screen>
      <para>This is a basic example where we mocked the data. For exercise, load your data
                    using the <literal>$http</literal> service.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>mypanel.html</title>
      <para>This is our view. In this example, we are looping through the list of items
                    provided by the controller and displaying the name and id. The important thing
                    to note is the reference to our controller using the <literal>ng-controller</literal>
                    directive.</para>
      <screen>&lt;div ng-controller="horizon.dashboard.identity.myPluginController as ctrl"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Loading data from your controller:&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li ng-repeat="item in ctrl.items"&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;{$ item.name $}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c2"&gt;{$ item.id $}&lt;/span&gt;

      <para>Step 3 installs your package into the Horizon’s virtual environment. You can
                    install your plugin without using <literal>with_venv.sh</literal> and <literal>pip</literal>. The package
                    would simply be installed in the <literal>PYTHON_PATH</literal> of the system instead.</para>
    </note>
    <para>If you are able to hit the URL pattern in <literal>urls.py</literal> in your browser, you have
                successfully deployed your plugin! For plugins that do not have a URL, check
                that your static resources are loaded using the browser inspector.</para>
    <para>Assuming you implemented <literal>my_rest_api.py</literal>, you can use a REST client to hit
                the url directly and test it. There should be many REST clients available on
                your web browser.</para>
    <para>Note that you may need to rebuild your virtual environment if your plugin is not
                showing up properly. If your plugin does not show up properly, check your
                <literal>.venv</literal> folder to make sure the plugin’s content is as you expect.</para>
    <note>
      <para>To uninstall, use <literal>pip uninstall</literal>. You will also need to remove the enabled
                    file from the <literal>local/enabled</literal> folder.</para>
