  <section>
    <title>Introduction:</title>
    <para>This directory is intended to hold any documentation that relates to
                how to contirbute to Cinder or how the project is managed.  Some of this
                content was previous under ‘developer’ in openstack-manuals.  The content
                of the documentation, however, goes beyond just developers to anyone
                contributing to the project, thus the change in naming.</para>
    <para>The full spec for organization of documentation may be seen in the
                <literal>OS Manuals Migration Spec
